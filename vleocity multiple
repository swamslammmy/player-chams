Sure, here's some sample code that multiplies the velocity of an object by a given factor:

lua
Copy code
-- function to multiply velocity
function multiplyVelocity(obj, factor)
  obj.velocity.x = obj.velocity.x * factor
  obj.velocity.y = obj.velocity.y * factor
end
This code defines a function called multiplyVelocity that takes two arguments: an object with a velocity property (which should have x and y properties), and a factor by which to multiply the velocity. The function then multiplies the x and y components of the velocity by the factor.

You can call this function like this:

lua
Copy code
-- example usage
local obj = { velocity = { x = 10, y = 5 } }
multiplyVelocity(obj, 2)
print(obj.velocity.x, obj.velocity.y) -- output: 20 10
This code creates an example object with an initial velocity of { x = 10, y = 5 }, calls multiplyVelocity with a factor of 2, and then prints out the updated velocity components.
